Home-Sweet-Home or HSH is a Unity3D video game where you play as a candy who wants to get home. The objective is to collect as many candies as possible, while avoiding the banana enemies and getting home in under 100 seconds.

HSH was created by members of the K. International School Programming Club. We won first place in the [Coding For Life](http://www.tokyosandbox.com/coding-for-life/) (high school only) arcade game competition at the [Tokyo Indie Fest](http://www.tokyosandbox.com/tokyo-indie-fest/) on Sunday May 14th 2017. We participated with the team name "K-IST Coders" and competed against 7 teams from 4 high schools in Tokyo. ([Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrjRR2MWY1E))
